        The female’s gestation period lasts 90 to 95 days. This means she is pregnant for about three months.

        Shortly before she is ready to give birth, the mother makes a den in a quiet hidden spot. She chooses her location in the tall grass and thick underbrush or near a clump of rocks.

        A cheetah gives birth to an average of five to six cubs. Each cub weights between 250 to 425 grams. Cubs are born completely helpless and with their eyes closed, but they develop rapidly. Scent and touch are used to find their mother’s nipples to suckle.

        They start crawling around the nest area at four to ten days when their eyes begin to open. At three weeks their teeth break through the gums.

        A mother cheetah will frequently move her litter. This prevents a build-up of scent of the den site, which may lead other predators to the cubs. She carries very young cubs in her jaws.

        The cubs are very vulnerable to lions, hyenas and other predators when the female leaves them alone. When hunting she may be away for up to 48 hours. In Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park, 90% of all cubs do not reach the age of 3 months! Other causes of death are abandonment when prey is scarce, exposure due to low temperatures or grass fires.

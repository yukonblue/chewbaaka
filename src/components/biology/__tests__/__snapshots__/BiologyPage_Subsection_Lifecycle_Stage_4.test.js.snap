        In Stage 4, cheetahs become sexually mature. Although they are mature at 16 to 18 months, most do not breed until they are three to five years old.

        At 20 - 30 months of age, females leave their litter-mates to find suitable mates and start their own families. They raise their families on their own without the help of the males.

        Males usually do not breed until they are 4 to 5 years of age, and dominant in a territory. They live alone or brothers form permanent groups called "coalitions". These groups stay together for life, claim territories, hunt and find mates together.
